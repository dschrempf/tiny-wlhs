We welcome contributions to the tinywl-hs project! Here's how you can help:

## PLEASE NOTE

The following guide was copied and pasted from another project of mine, at this early stage its more aspirational than a requirement.

## Reporting Issues

- Describe the issue in detail, including steps to reproduce

4. Write or update tests as necessary
5. Update documentation to reflect your changes
6. Commit your changes with a clear commit message

- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious code
- Ensure your code passes hlint suggestions
- Write Haddock documentation for exported functions

## Testing
